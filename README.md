## Introduction

Subscription-based businesses are everywhere. Foodie-Fi is a fictional streaming service for food-loving viewers (think: Netflix, but for cooking shows!). Founded by Danny Ma, Foodie-Fi offers monthly and annual subscriptions as well as a 7-day trial, and runs its business entirely data-driven. This project explores customer journeys, payment flows, and key analytics for such a subscription model using real business logic and modern SQL.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
There are two core tables:
- **plans**: Defines subscription products
- **subscriptions**: Records changes in each customer's plans over time

## Available Data

### Table 1: `plans`

| plan_id | plan_name       | price    |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| 0       | trial          | $0       |
| 1       | basic monthly  | $9.90    |
| 2       | pro monthly    | $19.90   |
| 3       | pro annual     | $199     |
| 4       | churn          | NULL     |

### Table 2: `subscriptions`

| customer_id | plan_id | start_date  |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 1           | 0       | 2020-08-01  |
| 1           | 1       | 2020-08-08  |
| 2           | 0       | 2020-09-20  |
| 2           | 3       | 2020-09-27  |
| ...         | ...     | ...         |

- Plans take effect on start_date, upgrades/downgrades are instant except churn, which completes at billing period end.
