-- A. Customer Journey

/*
Based on the sample of 8 customers from the subscriptions table, 
we'll analyze each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. We'll look at how they started, 
if and when they upgraded or downgraded, and whether they churned.

-- Build a dataset showing the journey of the 8 selected customers
-- We'll join plans and subscriptions, filtering only the relevant customers
