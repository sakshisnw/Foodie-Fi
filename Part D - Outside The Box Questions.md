## <p align="center"> Part D. Outside The Box Questions
---

### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

To measure Foodie-Fi‚Äôs growth, I‚Äôd look at both the change in active subscribers and recurring revenue over time.  
A simple yet effective formula is:

Growth Rate (%) = ((Current Subscribers ‚àí Past Subscribers) / Past Subscribers) √ó 100

Tracking subscriber or revenue growth each month, quarter, and year provides a clear view of momentum and business health.

### 2. What key metrics would you recommend management track?

If I were advising Foodie-Fi, I‚Äôd focus on these essentials:
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Are people actually using the product regularly?
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** and **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: How much money is coming in, both total and per person?
- **Churn Rate**: How many customers do we lose each month‚Äîand why?
- **Conversion Rate**: How effective is our funnel from ‚Äútrial‚Äù to ‚Äúpaying‚Äù?
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: How much can we expect to earn per customer before they leave?
- **Plan Mix**: What percent of users choose basic, pro, annual, etc.?

Continuously tracking these tells you what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs not, and where to invest next.

### 3. What customer journeys would you analyze to improve retention?

I‚Äôd be curious about:
- **Trial user journeys:** Where do we lose new users before they upgrade?
- **Upgrade/downgrade patterns:** What makes someone pay more‚Ä¶or less?
- **Engagement dips:** When do people stop watching, and what brings them back?
- **Churn triggers:** What‚Äôs happening right before someone cancels?
- **Support requests:** Are there patterns in help tickets that flag frustration?

Mapping these journeys lets us proactively solve problems before users walk away.

---

### 4. What questions would you include in a cancellation (exit) survey?

I‚Äôd keep it short, respectful, and meaningful:
- What‚Äôs your primary reason for leaving Foodie-Fi?
- Was there a feature or type of content you felt was missing?
- Was our pricing fair for what you received?
- How satisfied were you overall?
- Would you consider returning‚Äîif so, what would make you come back?
- Is there anything else you‚Äôd like us to know?

This approach shows we care, offers space for honest feedback, and signals that the door‚Äôs always open.

### 5. What can Foodie-Fi do to reduce churn, and how would you test if it works?

Smart moves might include:
- **Personalized experiences:** Tailor recommendations so everyone finds something they love.
- **Flexible plans:** Make it easy to pause, switch, or adjust a plan‚Äîrather than quit.
- **Exclusive content:** Offer premium videos or early access to keep people excited.
- **Proactive customer support:** Reach out when users seem inactive or frustrated.
- **Rewards and loyalty programs:** Celebrate milestones and reward long-term members.

To know if these work, I‚Äôd A/B test new features with a sample of users, track churn and engagement rates, and invite candid feedback. If churn drops and satisfaction rises, we‚Äôre on the right track.
