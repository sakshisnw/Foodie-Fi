## <p align="center"> Part A. Customer Journey

*Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief
description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also
want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!*

### Approach: Tracking Customer Journeys
1. Selected 8 Sample Customers
Focused on IDs: 1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19.

2. Joined subscriptions + plans
Pulled customer_id, plan_name, start_date.

3. Sorted by Customer & Date
To follow each customerâ€™s journey in order.

4. Summarized Journeys
Tracked plan changes: trial â†’ upgrades â†’ churn.
	
### Solution

```sql
-- selecting the unique customers based on the sample from the subscriptions table
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   p.plan_id, 
	   p.plan_name, 
	   s.start_date
FROM plans AS p
INNER JOIN subscriptions AS s
  ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
````
