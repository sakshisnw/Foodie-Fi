## <p align="center"> A. Customer Journey

*Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief
description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also
want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!*

### Steps to answering the question:

- The sample customer_id given in the sample subscription table are 1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19.Â 

- Create a base table with the following columns: customer_id, plan_id, plan_name, start_date.

- Order by Customer_id
	
### Solution

```sql
-- selecting the unique customers based on the sample from the subscriptions table
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   p.plan_id, 
	   p.plan_name, 
	   s.start_date
FROM plans AS p
INNER JOIN subscriptions AS s
  ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
````
